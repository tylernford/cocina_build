**We are Open and Offer Online Ordering, Curbside Pick-up & Catering Deliveries!**

If you want to **Dine-In**, tables are 6 FT apart, reservations can be made for 10 ppl or less and we are at 50% occupancy.

If you want to do **Curbside Pick-up** or want Catering Delivered then you can Order Online. You can select your items, pay online and either pick it up curbside or we can deliver your order (if you select that option under Catering).

Alcoholic beverages cannot be ordered to-go, but if you have a Catering order to be Delivered, then we can deliver our 214 Rocks and Sangria by the gallon. Each gallon serves about 14 drinks. If you want something that is not on our online menu, then contact our Catering Manger, Natalie and she can further help you. She can be reached at:
